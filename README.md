personal project with the goal of creating a program that will send a windows notification, with the time slightly randomized so I don't know exactly when it will occur.

current state of the program is semi-functional but not "release-ready". 

Inside the app, times of reminders can be added, edited, and saved. The program can run while minimized and send a reminder with a set message at specified times. Only windows 11 compatible since it relies on windows 11 toast to send desktop notifications.

Future implementations:
- Zen mode- displays no information about the time of the next reminder. Only widget is a back button.
- Customizable reminder message
- Cleaner GUI and consistent window size

Update September 2, 2024:
  I haven't intended to abandon this project but I also haven't worked on it in a long time. I hope to pick it back up when time permits.

Update Oct 18, 2024:
    I'm working on this on my laptop right now, which runs windows 10. I started this on my desktop that runs windows 11. I'm realizing this code might not even work on a lot of windows machines. I plan to reinvestigate how to send desktop notifications and, if applicable, add support for both windows 10 and 11. Not sure how easy it would be to incorperate linux distributions or macs into this, but I'll check this out soon.
