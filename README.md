personal project with the goal of creating a program that will send a windows notification, with the time slightly randomized so I don't know exactly when it will occur.

current state of the program is semi-functional but not "release-ready". 

Inside the app, times of reminders can be added, edited, and saved. The program can run while minimized and send a reminder with a set message at specified times. Only windows 11 compatible since it relies on windows 11 toast to send desktop notifications.

Future implementations:
- Zen mode- displays no information about the time of the next reminder. Only widget is a back button.
- Customizable reminder message
- Cleaner GUI and consistent window size
