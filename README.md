## Short description
This is a personal project designed to send desktop notifications at slightly randomized times. Inside the app, times of reminders can be added, edited, and saved. The program can run while minimized and send a reminder with a set message at specified times. This was concieved to help me during long class sessions where it's difficult to focus the whole time. The purpose of the randomization is so that I'm not necessarily watching the clock  the notifications were designed to act as a nudge away from distractions.

## Current state
The current state of the program is semi-functional, perhaps described as alpha, since it is able to do the core functionality of sending reminders but is unpolished.

### Most recent update:
  October 23, 2024:
     The app works on a very basic level again.I've migrated from windows 11 toast to desktop-notifier which claims to support multiple OSs. I don't know how to test that, but my primary concern is polishing the program to work on windows(specifically my personal machines), then extending OS compatability. I think I'm entering a time period where I will be able to make small updates periodically.
