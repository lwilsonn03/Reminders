# Update Log
### Update September 2, 2024:
I haven't intended to abandon this project but I also haven't worked on it in a long time. I hope to pick it back up when time permits. This log unfortunately will not cover the beginning of the development of this program since I was much less aware of the value of documentation, even for personal use.

From what I remember, I worked on this program Fall 2023 primarily and it has been dormant since. I can't remember the reasons I chose to use certain libraries or why I implemented certain specific design elements. Hopefully, I'll mitigate this in the future by writing a bit each time I revisit this program.

### Update Oct 18, 2024:
I'm working on this on my laptop right now, which runs windows 10. I started this on my desktop that runs windows 11. This program relies on windows 11 toast to send notifications, and now I'm realizing this code might not even work on a lot of windows machines. I plan to reinvestigate how to send desktop notifications and, if applicable, add support for both windows 10 and 11. Not sure how easy it would be to incorperate linux distributions or macs into this, but I'll check this out soon.

### Update October 23, 2024:
The app works on a very basic level again.I've migrated from windows 11 toast to desktop-notifier which claims to support multiple OSs. I don't know how to test that, but my primary concern is polishing the program to work on windows(specifically my personal machines), then extending OS compatability. I think I'm entering a time period where I will be able to make small updates periodically.
